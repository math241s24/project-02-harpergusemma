## Background

Commercial fishing in Alaska is a huge industry, as salmon is the main export product of the state after oil and natural gas. Commercial fishing contributes \~5% of Alaska's economy.

Salmon harvest in Alaska accounts for \~80% of the total North American wild-caught salmon.

Commercial fishing regulation changes combined with salmon habitat destruction and climate change leave fishermen constantly speculating about the effects of regulation changes on salmon populations.

## Methods: Salmon Data, Text Analysis

Salmon data from Alaska Department of Fish and Game

-every observation is one species of fish in one area of Alaska during one year

-number of fish, landed weight of fish, number of commercial fishing permits issued, number of processors, number of fishing vessels

## Methods: Salmon Data, Text Analysis

Commercial fishing regulation data in Alaska doesn't exist, but

The AK Legislature has a system of websites that show every single resolution and bill passed from the 18th legislature (1993) to the 33rd legislature (2023).
