Commercial fishing contributes \\~5% of Alaska's economy.\n\nSalmon harvest in Alaska accounts for \\~80% of the total North American wild-caught salmon.\n\nCommercial fishing regulation changes combined with salmon habitat destruction and climate change leave fishermen constantly speculating about the effects of regulation changes on salmon populations.\n\n## Methods: Salmon Data, Text Analysis\n\nSalmon data from Alaska Department of Fish and Game\n\n-every observation is one species of fish in one area of Alaska during one year\n\n-number of fish, landed weight of fish, number of commercial fishing permits issued, number of processors, number of fishing vessels\n\n## Methods: Salmon Data, Text Analysis\n\nCommercial fishing regulation data in Alaska doesn't exist, but\n\nThe AK Legislature has a system of websites that show every single resolution and bill passed from the 18th legislature (1993) to the 33rd legislature (2023).\n\n## Methods: Salmon Data, Text Analysis\n\n![](aklegpic.png)\n\n## Results: Salmon Data\n\n![](billwordfreq.png)\n\n## Results: Salmon Data\n\n![](fishcount.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Results: Shiny App\n\n![](appscreenshot.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
